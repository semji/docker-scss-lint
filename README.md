## What is scss-lint

`scss-lint` is a tool to help keep your [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) files
clean and readable by running it against a collection of
configurable [linter rules](lib/scss_lint/linter/README.md). You can run it
manually from the command line, or integrate it into your
[SCM hooks](https://github.com/brigade/overcommit).

You can get more informations at: [https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint).
